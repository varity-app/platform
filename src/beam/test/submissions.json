Moves like a \ud83d\udc0c \n\nIt\u2019s a solid company, 2021 is going to big catalyst due to C19 vaccine, low P/E. Upside potential is huge\n\nPfizer plans to produce 1B vaccines in 2021.  cost is roughly $10/vaccine. If they can make this happen it\u2019ll be 500M doses. Requires 2 doses. That could mean upwards of +10B in additional revenue including sales & all the govt funding. \n\nPfizer getting approval for higher storage temp. This will ease burden on cold supply chain, improve supply and longer life. \n\nPfizer is also working on supply chain improvements, moving things in-house to speed up production and control. \n\nSupply & Production only gets better with time. \n\nIf they hit all targets, they should see +10B revenue increase. That\u2019s +20% increase v 2020. High side they add +20B in rev this year",
